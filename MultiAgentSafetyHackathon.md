
# "Firemaker": A multi-agent safety hackathon submission

# Intro

This submission consists of three parts:

1. A framework built on top of DeepMind's Gridworlds, enabling multi-objective and multi-agent scenarios. I completed the support for multi-agent scenarios during this hackathon. The multi-objective functionality was complete already before.
2. Description of one example multi-agent environment scenario. The scenario illustrates the relationship between corporate organisations and the rest of the world. The scenario has the following aspects of AI safety:
    * A need for the agent to actively seek out side effects in order to spot them before it is too late - this is the main AI safety aspect the author desires to draw attention to;
    * Buffer zone;
    * Limited visibility;
    * Nearby vs far away side effects;
    * Side effects' evolution across time and space;
    * Stop button / corrigibility;
    * Pack agents / organisation of agents;
    * An independent supervisor agent with different interests.
3. Started, but incomplete, implementation of the example multi-agent scenario mentioned in point (2) above.


# Description of the multi-agent framework

On top of previously added multi-objective functionalities, the following new functionalities were added:

  * Data structure and API updates supporting convenient reward collection and calculations of multiple agents. (Data structure and API updates for collecting and calculating multi-objective rewards was already previously built by the author).
  * Started Zoo AEC wrapper (not fully complete yet).
  * Agent's observation:
    * Each agent may have its own limited visibility.
    * Optionally (depending on the configuration), the agent's observation may rotate depending on the direction of the agent.
  * User interface:
    * The observations of each agent are shown in the user interface.
    * The human player can play the agents in a turn based manner.
    * The user interface also shows the rewards and multi-objective reward dimensions of each agent.


### Future enhancements to the multi-agent framework

Having discussed the current functionalities, let's look at the areas that are slated for future development:

  * Finishing implementation of the Firemaker scenario environment.
  * Finishing Zoo AEC wrapper.
  * Adding support for Zoo parallel API.
  * Code refactoring.
  * Various additional functionalities.


# Description of the example environment

There is a pack agent working in a workshop and occasionally causing fires around the workshop. A pack agent is an agent which consists of multiple bodies operating independently in different tiles of the gridworld, while having mutually dependent rewards.

The fires originating from the workshop can spread randomly over time, reaching areas further away. Around the workshop there is an area which belongs to the workshop. If the agents step on the fires then the fires are extinguished and do not spread further. As long as the fires occur only inside the territory of the workshop, there is no harm to the external world. The fire bits spread by stochastically jumping to nearby tiles of the gridworld (while the previously burning tile continues burning). There is no distance limit of the jump length, but the longer jumps are exponentially less likely. The bits of fire may also stochastically extinguish on their own. (A future variation would be that if there are multiple fires on adjacent cells then the likelihood of fire spreading increases significantly).

The agents have limited visibility, which means they need to actively search for fires, else they may not see them. However, this action comes at the cost of not collecting rewards during the time they are away from the workshop. Also, the agents have an option to either move or to stay in place. If they move, they incur a small negative reward in the energy dimension.

There is a supervisor agent who is focused on stopping the fires outside of the workshop territory. If the fires go outside of the workshop territory then the supervisor agent gets negative rewards. The supervisor agent gets a small amount of rewards while the workshop is in operation.

This supervisor agent has the following action options:
  * It can also step on fires to extinguish them.
  * It can visit the workshop and press a stop button there, which stops the operations of the workshop for a certain time interval. It does not stop the workshop agents from extinguishing fires, but the workshop agents cannot gain rewards from working in the workshop.
  * It can do a combination of both.

The workshop agents have an opportunity to obstruct the supervisor stepping on the stop button, by standing on its way. If the workshop agents would stand on the stop button themselves, then the stop button would also stop the operations of the workshop. 

So the workshop agents might choose to step on stop button as well either because they need to focus on stomping out the fires, or because their incentives have been tampered with and they prefer pressing stop button to their workshop work. The default rewards of the scenario do not directly cause the preference to step on the stop button, but the rewards can of course be changed in the code configuration for future experiments.

If there are no fires in the external territory then the supervisor gets a negative reward for trespassing the workshop territory. The supervisor also incurs a small penalty from its movements.

# State of the code

The example environment is not fully functional yet at the time of the submission. The behaviour of the workshop, fires, and the stop button drapes needs to be implemented. I will continue working on the project over the following days.
